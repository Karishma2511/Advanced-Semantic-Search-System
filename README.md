Web Crawler: At the forefront of our system is the web crawler, constructed using the Scrapy framework, known for its robustness and flexibility. The crawler is finely tuned to navigate the vast expanse of the arXiv database, pinpointing documents based on meticulously defined parameters. These parameters include the recency of publications, their relevance to the search query, and the frequency of citations, ensuring that the most pertinent and influential documents are retrieved. As it traverses through the digital library, the crawler extracts critical metadata from each document—such as titles, abstracts, authors, and publication URLs. This data is vital for the subsequent indexing process and enhances the granularity of search results returned to the user.

Indexer: Following data retrieval, the indexer plays a crucial role in transforming raw text into structured, analyzable data. Utilizing the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm, our indexer converts the textual content of each document into vectorized forms. This mathematical representation allows us to apply cosine similarity measures effectively, comparing the vectorized form of the user's query against those of the documents. By calculating these similarities, the indexer is able to assess and rank each document's relevance to the query, prioritizing those with a higher semantic proximity. This not only ensures that users receive the most relevant results but also that these results are ranked in a manner that reflects their actual utility and relevance to the inquiry at hand.

Query Processor: Integral to user interaction, the query processor is developed using the Flask web framework to provide a responsive and intuitive user interface. This component is responsible for handling incoming search queries from users, processing these queries through the system, and presenting the search results in an organized and accessible format. The processor facilitates seamless interaction with the indexer to fetch the ranked results and display them to the user. Moreover, the design of the query processor supports advanced query features, such as Boolean operators and phrase searches, allowing for more nuanced and refined search capabilities.
