## Overview

The **Advanced Semantic Search System for Academic Research** is a tool designed to enhance the search experience for academic papers by providing more relevant results based on semantic understanding, rather than simple keyword matching. The system retrieves papers from the **arXiv repository** and ranks them using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

This project is aimed at researchers and academics who need a more effective way to find relevant research papers based on content similarity, not just keywords.

## Features

- **Web Crawling**: Collects metadata from the **arXiv** repository using a Python-based **Scrapy** crawler.
- **Semantic Search**: Utilizes **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity** algorithms to rank documents based on their semantic relevance to user queries.
- **User Interface**: A clean and simple search interface built with **Flask** for ease of use, enabling users to search for academic papers efficiently.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Continuously crawls and updates the database with the latest academic papers from the arXiv repository.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the implementation of core logic, crawling, and data processing.
- **Scrapy**: Web scraping framework used to extract academic paper metadata from the arXiv repository.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library used for implementing the **TF-IDF** vectorizer and computing **cosine similarity** for ranking documents.
- **Flask**: Micro web framework used to build the user interface for searching academic papers.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library used to clean and process paper metadata.

## Future Improvements

- **Advanced Filtering**: Implement filters such as date range, categories, and authors to further refine search results.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Add interactive data visualizations to display trends or connections between papers.
- **Paper Recommendation System**: Develop a recommendation engine to suggest papers based on a user’s past search history and interests.
